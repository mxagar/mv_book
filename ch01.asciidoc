// Steger, Ulrich, Wiedemann

== 1.1 Common tasks solved in machine vision
* Object identification: classify

* Position detection: locate known objects

* Completeness checking
- Was product assembled correctly?

* Shape and dimensional inspection: check geometric parameters

* Surface inspection: scratches, etc.

== 1.2 Components of a typical machine vision system

*See Fig 1.1, page 2*

* Object carried maybe in conveyor belt

* Photoelectric sensor triggers camera, which acquires image
- Lens an dobjective of the camera carefully chosen

* Object illuminated with specially designed illumination
- Example: stroboscopic lamp = flashes, instants illuminated

* Camera deliver image to a camera-computer interface
- example: a frame grabber
- if not a frame grabber, we can use a standard interface
. Firewire
. USB (3)
. Ethernet

* Computer can be: regular, industrial PC, computer integrated to camera (embedded devices)

* Computer can have
- a standard processor
- a digital signal processor (DSP)
- a fiel-programmable gate array (FPGA)

* Image processing happens and an action can be triggered
- Action is communicated to a controller, eg a PLC
- The controller communicates and activates an actuator
. Interfaces
.. Time critical, realtime: fieldbus
.. Non time-critical: ethernet
