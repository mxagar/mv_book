== 2.1 Illumination

=== 2.1.1 Electromagnetic Radiation

* Light: electromagnetic radiation

* Black body: absorbs all electromagnetic radiation and serves as an ideal source of thermal radiation
- Therefore, radiance is function of temperature...

* Spectral radiance of a black body given by Planck's law
- I(lambda, T) = spectral radiance = k1 / (lambda^5 * (exp(k2/(lambda*T)) - 1))
. *See formula and image: Fig. 2.1, page 7*
. lambda: wave length - visible: 380-780 nm
. T: temperature
.. 1000K: red glow
.. 3000K: lamp
.. 6500K: daylight

=== 2.1.2 Types of light sources

* Incandescent lamps: filament which works as a resistance in vacuum
- 5% efficiency
- Color temperature: 3000 - 4000K

* Xenon lamps: sealed lamp with xenon, which is ionized
- Temperature: 5500 - 12000K
- 200 flashes/second

* Fluorescent lamps
- Mercury vapor exited in noble gas (eg, argon), causing UV radiation
- Temperature: 3000 - 6000K
- Alternate current: flickering lamp -- for machine vision, this must be avoided using alternate currents of about 22 kHz

* LEDs: Light Emitting Diodes: used primarily in machine vision applications
- Direct current
- Diodes that emit light
- Large longevity: 100k hours
- Can be used as flashes, with fast response time
- Little power consumed and little heat produced

=== 2.1.3 Interaction of Light and Matter

* Microstructure of the matter/object/surface determined reflection of light

* Light incident onto a surface can be
- Reflected
. Diffuse: light reflected and scattered in all directions
. Specular: light reflected in one direction: incoming and reflected light in a single plane and their angles wrt surface normal (macrostructure) are constant -- example: mirror
-  Transmitted (eg, with semi/transparent surfaces)
. Diffuse: goes through materia in a scattered manner
. Direct: goes through material in a given direction; refraction occurs usually: incidence direction is changed inside material
- Absorbed: radiation energy absorbed by surface material: converted into heat

* Fraction of light reflected by a surface determined by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)

=== 2.1.4 Using the Spectral Composition of the Illumination

* Example in practice: if a red object in green background needs to be enhanced, red illumination can be used: red object will appear bright and green dark

* CCD and CMOS sensors are sensitive to IR light: same effect: they are enhanced

* Polarization
- Light becomes partially polarized through reflection in metallic surfaces: it takes certain directions -- ie, angle of EM waves wrt ray of incidence
- Polarizing filters suppress polarized light: reflections in a given direction
- Even better suppression if the light source is polarized
. Light source is polarized with filter
. A filter called analyzed is used in front of the camera which filters all polarized rays â†’ specular reflections are suppressed

=== 2.1.5 Using the Directional Properties of the Illumination

* Light ray direction can be
- Diffuse: all directions
- Narrow range of directions, parallel rays: directed/telecentric illumination

* Light source placement can be
- Front: same side of camera (pointing in the same direction as cameras)
- Back: the opposite side of the object to the camera

* Angle of reflected light can be
- Bright-field: angle light source so that light reflect to camera
- Dark-field: angle light source so that light reflected away from camera

* The above features can be combined and used in suited scenarios
- Diffuse + front + bright-field: homogeneous lighting, avoid shadows, look through transparent objects
- Directed/Telecentric + front + bright-field: create shadows around objects of interest; parts parallel to image plane reflect light to camera
- Directed/Telecentric + front + dark-field: highlight indentations and protussions on rather planar surfaces, eg coin engravings, braille dots, scratches
- Diffuse + back + bright-field: almost planar objects (small depth) acquired with white background and whole object dark/black: silhouette of opaque objects
- Directed/telecentric + back + bright-field: as before, silhouette of object captured; telecentric lenses are necessary for the camera and the light source must be aligned with camera; very sharp edges and no perspective distorsions --> often used for measuring
